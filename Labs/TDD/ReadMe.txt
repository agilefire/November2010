------------------------

If you are using one of the refactoring tool that comes with unit test runner (e.g. ReSharper or CodeRush) then there is no installation step for you! Just open up your test runner after compiling the solution and the unit tests should appear.

Everybody else
--------------

To run the unit tests, a 'test runner' app is needed. For NUnit, it is the NUnit GUI application. It is located at <Code location>\lib\NUnit-2.5.9.10348\bin\net-2.0\nunit.exe or nunit-x86.exe (depending on your OS architecture).

Run the NUnit GUI, and load the NUnit project (File->Open Project) and navigate to the NUnit project file. For the 'start' solution, the file is located at same location as the sln file, e.g. <Code location>\TDD-Primes-Start.nunit
